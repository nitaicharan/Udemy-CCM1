# Spec for Login Form Functionality

branch: claude/feature/login-form-functionality

## Summary

Implement authentication functionality for the login form at `/login`. Users should be able to submit their credentials and be logged in when the credentials are correct. Upon successful login, display a success message to the user without redirecting to another page.

## Functional Requirements

- The existing LoginForm component should integrate with Firebase Authentication
- When the user submits the login form with valid credentials (email and password), authenticate them using Firebase
- On successful login, display a success message to the user
- On failed login (invalid credentials), display an appropriate error message
- Handle loading states while the authentication request is in progress
- The form should validate that email and password fields are not empty before submission
- No redirect should occur after successful login (this will be implemented later)
- The authenticated user state should be managed through the existing AuthProvider context

## Possible Edge Cases

- User submits empty form fields
- User enters invalid email format
- User enters incorrect password
- User account does not exist
- Firebase authentication service is unavailable or times out
- User is already logged in when accessing the login page
- Network connection issues during authentication

## Acceptance Criteria

- User can successfully log in with valid credentials
- Success message is displayed after successful login
- Error message is displayed when login fails with specific reason (e.g., "Invalid credentials", "User not found")
- Form shows loading state during authentication
- Form validates required fields before submission
- Authentication state is properly updated in AuthProvider context
- Existing tests for LoginForm component continue to pass
- User avatar in Navbar updates to show logged-in user after successful login

## Open Questions

- What should the exact wording of the success message be? Login successful
- Should the success message auto-dismiss after a certain time, or require user action? no
- Should we prevent logged-in users from accessing the login page? not yet.

## Testing Guidelines

Create test file(s) in the `./tests` folder for the new feature, and create meaningful tests for the following cases, without going too heavy:

- LoginForm successfully authenticates user with valid credentials
- LoginForm displays error message on invalid credentials
- LoginForm shows loading state during authentication
- LoginForm validates empty fields before submission
- AuthProvider context is updated after successful login
- Success message is displayed after successful authentication
- Error handling for network failures or Firebase errors
