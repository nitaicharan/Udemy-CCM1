# Spec for authentication-forms

branch: claude/feature/authentication-forms

## Summary

Implement functional authentication forms on the `/login` and `/signup` pages with email and password fields, password visibility toggle, and submit functionality. Forms should log credentials to the console on submission. Users should be able to easily navigate between login and signup forms.

## Functional Requirements

- Email input field with appropriate type and validation attributes
- Password input field with toggle visibility functionality
- Hide/show password icon that switches between masked and plain text
- Submit button labeled "Log In" on login page and "Sign Up" on signup page
- Form submission handler that logs email and password to console
- Prevent default form submission behavior (no page reload)
- Links or buttons to navigate between login and signup pages
- Form validation feedback for empty or invalid email/password fields
- Accessible form labels and ARIA attributes where appropriate
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## Possible Edge Cases

- User submits form with empty email field
- User submits form with empty password field
- User submits form with invalid email format
- User rapidly toggles password visibility
- User navigates between forms without clearing previous input
- User uses browser autofill for credentials
- User presses Enter key to submit form

## Acceptance Criteria

- Email and password fields render correctly on both pages
- Password visibility toggle icon changes state and reveals/hides password text
- Clicking submit button logs form data to browser console
- Form does not trigger page reload on submission
- Users can navigate between login and signup pages easily
- Form fields have appropriate HTML5 validation attributes
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Forms display consistent styling with existing design system

## Open Questions

- Should we validate email format before allowing submission? Light validation.
- Should we enforce minimum password length requirements? No.
- Should form inputs persist when navigating between login/signup? No.
- Do we need "Remember me" checkbox on login form? No.
- Should we include "Forgot password" link on login form? No.

## Testing Guidelines

Create test files in the `./tests` folder for the authentication forms, and create meaningful tests for the following cases:

- Form renders with all required fields and submit button
- Password visibility toggle switches between hidden and visible states
- Form submission prevents default behavior and logs credentials to console
- Submit button displays correct label for login vs signup context
- Email field accepts valid email format
- Password field accepts text input and masks by default
- Navigation between login and signup forms works correctly
- Form validation prevents submission with empty required fields
